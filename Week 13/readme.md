# Sorting and Searching Algorithms in C++

This project implements and compares several classical sorting and searching algorithms in C++. It includes performance analysis through comparisons, exchanges, and execution time.

## 🔍 Included Algorithms

### Sorting
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Heap Sort

### Searching
- Sequential Search
- Binary Search

## 📊 Features
- Time measurement (using `clock()` and `time()`)
- Count of comparisons and exchanges
- Performance testing on varying input sizes
- Success vs. failure case analysis for searches

## 🛠️ How to Run
Compile using any C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ -o sort_search main.cpp
./sort_search
