The concep that we learned on lab of week 1 covers various fundamental and advanced C++ programming concepts through multiple implementations. It starts with a Complex Number Operations program, demonstrating object-oriented programming (OOP) by implementing a class for complex numbers with overloaded operators for addition, subtraction, and multiplication, along with a method to calculate the magnitude. The second program introduces class templates through a `mypair` class, which can handle different data types and provides functions to determine the maximum and minimum values. 

Following that, a template-based sequence class (`mysequence`)is implemented, which utilizes a non-type template parameter for array size and includes methods to store values and find the minimum and maximum elements in the sequence. The journal also includes a **file handling** program that reads a text file (`fin.txt`), copies its contents to another file (`fout.txt`), and counts the number of characters, words, and sentences, demonstrating file input/output operations in C++. 

Additionally, an object-oriented house information management system** is implemented, which allows users to input house details such as owner name, address, number of bedrooms, and price, storing them in an array and displaying them in a formatted manner using iomanip manipulators (`setw`, `setprecision`). The lab also contains a student grades management system, which dynamically allocates memory to store student names and grades, reads data from a file (`input.dat`), and provides functionalities to view all students' grades, calculate individual averages, and determine the highest and lowest average grades. This section further enhances understanding of dynamic memory allocation (`new`, `delete`), arrays of objects**, and **interactive menu-driven programs.

Overall, this lab journal effectively demonstrates essential C++ programming concepts, including OOP, templates, file handling, operator overloading, data processing, and dynamic memory management. Through practical implementations, it provides a strong foundation for writing efficient and structured C++ programs.
