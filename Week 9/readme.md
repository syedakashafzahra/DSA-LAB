This C++ program implements a template-based Binary Search Tree (BST) that supports insertion, deletion, search, and in-order traversal. It demonstrates how to store and sort an array of strings using the BST structure. The TreeType class is fully generic, allowing it to work with any data type. In the main() function, five strings are inserted into the tree and then printed in sorted order to a file named out.txt. The program uses #include <iostream> for console output and #include <fstream> for file handling.
