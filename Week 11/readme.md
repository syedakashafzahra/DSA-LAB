This project includes two exercises focused on graph algorithms using adjacency matrices in C++. Exercise 11.1 covers the construction of a graph using a 2D matrix, followed by the implementation of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). BFS explores nodes level by level using a queue, while DFS dives deep into each branch using recursion. The program outputs the order of node traversal starting from a user-defined node. Exercise 11.2 implements Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, which calculates the shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. It uses a greedy approach to continuously pick the minimum distance vertex not yet processed. Both exercises are valuable for understanding how graphs can be represented and traversed, and how optimal paths can be found in weighted networks.
